# Newt Alternative
A \[ server-side / host-only \] mod that aims to make the *Bazaar Between Time* less exploitable.

*[ **!** ]* not thoroughly tested; untested in multiplayer

## effect
1. each lunar bud can only be opened once per loop
    - prevent users with edited lunar coins from amassing large amounts of *(specific)* lunar items *(through rerolling)*
2. newt altars cost 0 lunar coins
    - counterbalance the lunar bud nerf
    - make seeking newt altars a bit more enticing
