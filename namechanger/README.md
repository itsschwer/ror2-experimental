# name changer

A client-side mod that allows you to change your in-game\* name without having to change your Steam/Epic profile name.

*\*does not affect the lobby player list or "user connected" messages.*

## why?

I saw a request for it in the modding Discord server.

## notes

not much testing has been performed.
